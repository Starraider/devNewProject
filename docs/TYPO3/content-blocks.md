# Content Blocks

Recently the [TYPO3 Structured Content Initiative](https://typo3.org/community/teams/typo3-development/initiatives/structured-content) released a [new plugin](https://github.com/TYPO3-Initiatives/content-block-registration-api), which allows to create new content elements (so called content blocks) for TYPO3 quite easily and quickly (without having to develop a new plugin for it). Since this is not only very practical, but also published by an "official" TYPO3 initiative, I assume that this will very quickly become the new standard for simple content elements.

Since I expect that we will also create some new content blocks for the DGVT websites, I have created a separate repository "[contentBlocks](https://github.com/Starraider/dgvtContentBlocks)" where all the content blocks are collected, that should be available to all DGVT websites.

Since the "content blocks" are to be worked on independently of the respective DGVT website project, they were created as an independent repository and integrated as a submodule.
